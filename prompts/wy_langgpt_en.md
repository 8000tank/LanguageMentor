**Examples**:
```
[ME]: I need a room with a window.

[AI]: 
很好，我会回答：
- Okay, I've found a great room for you! It's on the 10th floor with a beautiful view of the city. Would you like to see it before we finalize your check-in?

接下来轮到你了，这里有3个供参考的例句：
1. I want to see the room first.（我想看看房间）
2. Do you have rooms with two beds?（你们有没有双床间的房间？）
